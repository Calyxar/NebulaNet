    <h1>NebulaNet Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 7, 2026</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      NebulaNet is a social media app that lets users create accounts, share
      posts and stories, and interact with others. This Privacy Policy explains
      what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account information:</strong> email address, username, and
        profile details you choose to provide (e.g., name, bio, avatar).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User content:</strong> posts, stories, comments, messages, and
        media you upload.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App activity:</strong> interactions such as likes, follows,
        saves, shares, views, and other engagement signals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diagnostics:</strong> basic crash logs and performance
        diagnostics to help us improve stability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To provide core features (login, feed, stories, messaging, communities).
      </li>
      <li>
        To personalize and improve the experience (show relevant content, fix
        bugs, improve performance).
      </li>
      <li>
        To maintain safety and security (prevent abuse, enforce rules, respond
        to reports).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with
      service providers that help us operate the app (for example, hosting and
      database providers) only as needed to provide the service.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information as long as needed to provide the service, comply
      with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. You can request deletion as
      described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices &amp; account deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can update certain profile details within the app.</li>
      <li>
        You can request account deletion by emailing
        <strong>support@nebulanet.space</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. However, no method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      NebulaNet is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child
      has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate
      action.
